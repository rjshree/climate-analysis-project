## Tasks
1. Setup a database of your choice. Create a table Global_Land_Temperatures_By_City
with an appropriate table schema and load the data of
GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv into the table. 

I used MySQL 8.0.29 community server  and loaded the data via MySQL Workbench. I faced challenges in loading data in my personal pc due to space issue.
Hence I was able to load only 10 lakhs records.
